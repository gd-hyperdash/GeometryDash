# Geometry Dash

This repo contains the header files necessary to interface with [Geometry Dash](https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Geometry_Dash). The headers are the result of an on-going reverse engineering process; as such, they might not be 100% accurate. Any issue should be reported in the appropriate [tab](https://github.com/gd-hyperdash/GeometryDash/issues).

**Note**: the headers are meant to be used with the HyperDash SDK, which uses a custom toolchain; they will not work standalone, and no support will be given for purposes other than developing HyperDash mods.
